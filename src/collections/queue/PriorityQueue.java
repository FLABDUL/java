/*
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Inserting an element: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.
 *   This is because the queue is a heap, and inserting requires placing the new element at the end and then bubbling it up.
 * - Removing the element (polling): O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.
 *   This is because the queue needs to replace the root (highest or lowest priority element) and then bubble down to maintain heap properties.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.
 *   The priority queue stores all elements, so its space usage is proportional to the number of elements it holds.
 *
 * Uses:
 * - Priority Queues are used when we need efficient access to the largest or smallest element without needing to sort the entire collection.
 * - They are commonly used in scenarios like:
 *   1. Implementing scheduling algorithms (e.g., task scheduling with priority).
 *   2. Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.
 *   3. Merging sorted streams (e.g., in external sorting).
 *
 * Pros:
 * - Efficient for retrieving the highest (or lowest) priority element in O(log n) time.
 * - Easy to implement using Java's `PriorityQueue` class with built-in heap functionality.
 * - Insertion and removal are much faster than sorting the entire collection.
 * - Can be used for both min-heaps and max-heaps by providing a custom comparator.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - Not suitable for scenarios where you need to access arbitrary elements efficiently, as it doesnâ€™t support random access.
 * - The elements are not stored in a sorted order, so traversing them takes linear time.
 *
 * Summary:
 * - A `PriorityQueue` is useful for cases where the data needs to be processed according to priority (e.g., smallest or largest element).
 * - The time complexity for insertion and removal is O(log n), making it much faster than sorting the entire collection, but it lacks efficient random access.
 * - It is ideal for priority-based processing but not well-suited for applications where you need to frequently access arbitrary elements.
